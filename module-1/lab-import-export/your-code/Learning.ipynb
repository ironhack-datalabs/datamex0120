    "Lesson Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "    Learn how to import and export delimited files with Pandas.\n",
    "    Learn how to import and export JSON files.\n",
    "    Learn how to read data from a database.\n",
    "    Learn how to write data to a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "No analytics tool operates in a vacuum. Most of the time, the systems that generate the data are not the ones where analysis of that data is conducted. Because of this, we must have a way to obtain data from external data sources, load it into Pandas, and also be able to export data or our results for further use or presentation. In this lesson, we will cover ways to import data from, and export data to, a variety of formats and destinations using Pandas.\n",

    "# Importing and Exporting Delimited Files\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most common places where data originates are delimited files. Most analytics applications have the ability to read and process delimited files, so they are a popular way to pass information from one system to another. There a few common file formats you are likely to see out in the real world.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Comma-separated variable (CSV) files\n",
    "    Tab-delimited files\n",
    "    Pipe-delimited files\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas provides us with the ability to import any of these using the read_csv method. For files delimited with characters other than commas, we just need to specify the type of delimiter via the method's sep parameter so that Pandas knows how it should separate the values. "

Below are a few other common ways that JSON files can be structured and the corresponding value you should pass to the orient parameter for each one.\n",
