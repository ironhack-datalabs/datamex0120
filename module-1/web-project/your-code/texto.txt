What if that’s not actually true? Perhaps it’s more useful to consider that in every moment, on every project, no one is actually doing their best.

Because there’s always a need to hold a little bit in reserve.

Because there are always competing priorities.

Because everyone has a noise in their head.

Because there’s fear, a hundred kinds of fear.

Because no one has actually done the lopsided work of 100% preparation and commitment, not for this precise moment.

I’m not doing my best and neither are you. Because we’re not optimized algorithms, we’re people.

Okay, now that we can see that no one is doing their best, what are our options?
