    "In this lesson we will continue to explore hypothesis tests and learn about performing tests with two samples of data.\n",
    "Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "It is common for researchers to perform studies to compare two groups and check if they behave differently. One example is applying a treatment to one group while another is left untreated. The results are then compared to see if the two groups differ. Hypothesis tests shine the most in such problems where we need to use statistics to inform decision making. In this lesson we will learn about the different ways we can compare two samples to see if they differ significantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Matched Pairs\n",
    "\n",
    "When we approach a two sample hypothesis test, we must first determine what type data we have. The first type of 2 sample hypothesis test is performed on matched pairs. This means that the data in the two samples is dependent. For example, in a clinical drug trial, we may give a blood pressure medication to a group of people and look at their blood pressure before and after the treatment. We will then treat the before and after as two samples and compare them. However, since the two groups both contain the same people, we are able to match each entry in the before data with its corresponding entry of the after data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A Bit of Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the we can match the data between the samples, we take the difference between the two samples in each row and then revert to using a one sample hypothesis test. Our hypothesis test will check whether the mean of the differences is significantly different from zero (we could also test that the mean is greater than or less than zero using a one-sided hypothesis test)."

While they are not the same person, they most likely live in the same household. Therefore, there are some things that they do that might be similar like sleep habits or commuting habits.
